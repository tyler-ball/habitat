Habitat has strong cryptography built into both Habitat Builder and the Supervisor. This means there are several different kinds of keys.

## Origin Key Pairs

Every package and artifact in Habitat belongs to an [origin](/docs/glossary/#glossary-packages) and is cryptographically signed with that origin's private key.
Habitat requires the public origin key for working with origin packages, both to produce the un-compiled package and to consume the compiled Habitat artifact, or `.hart`.
On the production side, Builder--both the service and the Depot--use the origin private key to transmit packages between your development environment to Builder. On the consumption side, the Supervisors require the origin private key to verify the compiled artifacts.

Origin key cryptography is asymmetric: it has a public key that you can distribute freely, and a private key that you should keep safe.

Habitat uses the public origin key to verify the integrity of a downloaded Habitat artifact before running it.
By default, Supervisors only run artifacts for which they have the public origin key, and will not run a package without it.
You can provide a public origin key to the Supervisors by pointing them to a Builder site that has it, or by saving the key onto disk outside of Habitat.

## User and Service Group Keys

User and service group keys are used to set up trust relationships between these two entities. Service groups can be set up to reject communication (e.g. applying new configuration via `hab config apply`) from untrusted users.

By default, service groups will trust *any* communication, so for a production deployment of Habitat, setting up these relationships is essential.

User and service group keys also utilize asymmetric cryptography. To apply configuration changes to service groups when running in this mode, a user uses their own private key to encrypt configuration information for a service group, using that service group's public key. The service group then uses its private key to decrypt the configuration information, and the user's public key to verify.

## Ring Encryption Key

A Supervisor ring can be optionally set up to encrypt *all* communication across the network. This requires the use of a symmetric pre-shared key. Any Supervisor joining the ring that does not present this key will be rejected.
